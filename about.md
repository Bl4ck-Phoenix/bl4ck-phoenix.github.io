# ðŸ§  About Bl4ck Phoenix Research

I created **Bl4ck Phoenix Research** as a personal archive of my thoughts, tools, techniques, and ideas in the world of software reverse engineering, anti-cheat analysis, and digital protection bypassing.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Mission

Globally, I seek to push myself beyond traditional barriers like **CTFs, DRM schemes, anti-cheat systems**, and into the realm where only the most elite operate.

My motivation? To compete with figures like **EMPRESS** and **Voksi** (yes, this is my dream :-( ). These names represent the peak of digital defiance, and I aim to be part of that echelon.


## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

This blog is a **living archive of documented research**, organized and methodically tested. It includes:

- Reverse engineering notes and logs
- Anti-cheat bypass methodologies
- Malware analysis
- DRM analysis  
- Packer analysis
- Obfuscation analysis
- Kernel-level code and experiments
- User-mode code that i may use
- Project breakdowns
- Conceptual ideas and proofs-of-concept  
<br>
Every post is a piece of my journey â€” shared not just for myself, but for the underground minds out there thinking the same way.  


I believe in open knowledge for the curious and fearless. The community gave me the spark, and I return the flame â€” with research that's accessible, organized, and detailed.

## ðŸ§© Notes

Some posts may contain **mistakes, misassumptions, or outdated info**. If you catch something off â€” whether itâ€™s technical, factual, or stylistic â€” Iâ€™d seriously appreciate a heads-up.
